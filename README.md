# CNN_for_cancers
This is the first project I take part in and I finished it with my friends two years ago. Though it may not contribute to you now. But maybe you can still see some old tensorflow codes which once were rather simple.

And the UI_FINAL.py is an UI interface that can simply put a picture into and give a test result.

At that time, I do some improvements to my simple Lenet.I add BN layers and dropout layer in the model. It had a better result that time.

DATASET:
the dataset is open-source in kaggle.
